The WiDE workshop aims to bring together researchers working on all aspects of distributed workflows. Workflow models represent a powerful abstraction for designing complex applications and executing them on large-scale distributed architectures. However, modelling, orchestrating, and monitoring distributed workflows pose unique challenges that raise many research questions. Managing distributed workflows is a complex task which covers a broad range of diverse topics and their need to interoperate: design patterns and languages, orchestration tools, scheduling and fault-tolerance algorithms, performance monitoring, benchmarking procedures, distributed FAIRness, end-to-end privacy and security, and many more. Plus, the modular nature of modern applications and the heterogeneity in contemporary hardware require workflow systems to support a large ecosystem of execution environments (from HPC to cloud, to the Edge), optimisation policies (performance vs. energy efficiency) and computational models (from classical to quantum). In the same spirit that inspired the [Workflow Community Initiative](https://workflows.community/), the WiDE workshop will allow researchers to share their knowledge on specific aspects of the topic and gain insights from different points of view. Direct exchange of views and ideas will be further encouraged by an open discussion session at the end of the event.

## Keynote Speaker: Michael R. Crusoe

## Paper Submission

The WiDE workshop follows a double-blind review procedure. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments), and they should use care in referring to their own related work.

Submissions may have **at most 6 pages of technical content**, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 6-page limit. In addition, submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for supplementary material in appendices. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper.

All submissions must use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by ≥8 mm (0.33″) of whitespace. Use ≥10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on ≥12-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered. Authors are encouraged to hyperlink their references.

ACM SIGPLAN paper [templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) are available in MS Word and LaTex. For any paper parameters not defined above, assume that the required value is the one used in the ACM SIGPLAN templates. Any papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.

The WiDE workshop promotes Open Science. Publishing Open Access data, code, and article preprints on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), [TechRxiv.org](https://www.techrxiv.org/), or any not-for-profit preprint server approved by the ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy does not in any way prevent the submission to the WiDE workshop.
