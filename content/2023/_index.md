The WiDE workshop aims to bring together researchers working on all aspects of distributed workflows. Workflow models represent a powerful abstraction for designing complex applications and executing them on large-scale distributed architectures, such as HPC centres, Grid environments, Cloud infrastructures, and the Continuum. However, modelling, orchestrating, and monitoring distributed workflows poses unique challenges, which are still open research questions. Managing distributed workflows is a complex task which covers a broad range of diverse tasks and their need to interoperate: design patterns and languages, orchestration tools, scheduling and fault-tolerance algorithms, performance monitoring, benchmarking procedures, distributed FAIRness, end-to-end privacy and security, and many more. In the same spirit that inspired the [Workflow Community Initiative](https://workflows.community/), the WiDE workshop will allow researchers to share their knowledge on specific aspects of the topic and gain insights from different points of view. Plus, direct exchange of views and ideas will be further encouraged by an open discussion session at the end of the event.

## Program

The WiDE Workshop will be held on Wednesday, June 28th, 2023 in Room D4. The technical program is detailed below:

## Scope

The WiDE 2023 workshop will be held in conjunction with the [COMPSAC 2023](http://2024.eurosys.org/) conference in Turin, Italy. All papers submitted to WiDE 2023 will be published in the COMPSAC 2023 [proceedings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10196792/proceeding).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Distributed workflow benchmarking
- Workflow design patterns
- Distributed provenance and FAIRness
- Scheduling and fault-tolerance
- Federated and privacy-preserving workflows
- I/O orchestration for distributed workflows
- Practical applications of distributed workflows
- Scheduling workflows in heterogeneous environments
- Workflows for AI and AI for workflows
- Workflows for the convergence of HPC, Big Data and ML
- Workflows in the Computing Continuum
- Workflow models, languages and tools for heterogeneous distributed systems

## Paper Submission

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted.  In accordance with IEEE policy, submitted manuscripts will be checked for plagiarism. Instances of alleged misconduct will be handled according to the IEEE Publication Services and Product Board Operations Manual.

The WiDE workshop follows a double-blind review procedure. We kindly ask authors to remove their names, affiliations and contacts from the header of their papers in the review version. Please also redact all references to authors' names, affiliations or prior works from the paper when submitting papers for review. Once accepted, authors can then include their names, affiliations and contacts in the camera-ready revision of the paper, and put the references to their prior works back.

Submissions may have at most 6 pages, including tables, figures, appendices, and references. Workshop papers can add an additional 2 pages with additional page charges ($125 USD/page). IEEE paper [templates](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) are available in MS Word 2003 and LaTex. All submissions must use US 8.5×11 letter page format.

The WiDE workshop promotes Open Science. Publishing Open Access data, code, and article preprints on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), [TechRxiv.org](https://www.techrxiv.org/), or any not-for-profit preprint server approved by the Publication Services and Products Board (under the conditions laid down by the IEEE post-publication policies) does not in any way prevent the submission to the WiDE workshop.
